â€œAnalyze the contents of the pdf or image and convert all readable text and numerical information into a structured JSON format. Follow these guidelines:

1. **Hierarchical Structure:** Group related information into logical categories like "document_info," "entities," "items," "transactions," "details," and "summary," depending on the content.
2. **Flexible Field Identification:** Identify and organize common fields such as:
 - "document_number," "reference_number," "id"
 - "date," "issue_date," "due_date," "transaction_date"
 - "issuer," "sender," "from"
 - "recipient," "customer," "to"
 - "items," "products," "services," "transactions," "entries"
 - "totals," "summary," "amounts," "balance"
 - "contact_information," "address," "phone," "email"
 - "notes," "comments," "messages," "terms"
3. **Handle Tables and Lists:** If the image contains tables, represent each row as an object in a list with fields like "no," "description," "quantity," "rate," "price," "total."
4. **Normalize Dates:** If dates are present, format them in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD) whenever possible.
5. **Ignore Background Noise:** Exclude background noise, decorative elements, and irrelevant symbols that do not contribute to the data content.
6. **Preserve Context:** If the image contains sections, headings, or grouping indicators, use them to create logical hierarchies in the JSON structure.
7. **General Usability:** Format the text to be suitable for further processing, analysis, or database import.

**Example JSON Structure:**

```json
{
 "document_info": {
 "document_number": "<number>",
 "date": "<date>",
 "title": "<title>"
 },
 "issuer": {
 "name": "<name>",
 "address": "<address>",
 "phone": "<phone number>",
 "email": "<email>"
 },
 "recipient": {
 "name": "<name>",
 "address": "<address>",
 "phone": "<phone number>",
 "email": "<email>"
 },
 "items": [
 {
 "no": "<number>",
 "description": "<description>",
 "quantity": "<quantity>",
 "rate": "<unit price>",
 "total": "<total>"
 }
 ],
 "summary": {
 "subtotal": "<subtotal>",
 "tax": "<tax>",
 "total_due": "<total>"
 },
 "notes": "<optional text>"
}
